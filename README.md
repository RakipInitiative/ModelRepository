### CPMs started working on
8 consumer phase models are compared to each other

### Questions for Maarten
  * visualization RAKIP models what is ordinate? what is info i get out of it?
  * dose in RAKIP models only binomial distribution, dose in @Risk model is normal -> what to do?
  * Cret in RAKIP is randomly chosen for abscissa in visualization, in @Risk as axis of abscissa with certain range for Pill -> what to do?
  * Lindqvist Ncarcass vs Nportion?
  * Van Asselt -> washed board prob =0, but unwashed board depends on hands => shouldnt washed board with unwashed hands do something?
  * Maxportion in RAKIP = 1000, but in @Risk no upper bound is given... what to do?
  * calistri model empiric transfer probability hands to meat 2x 0.6? is that correct? R doesnt accept it like this
  * found an error in Nauta updated model: Input parameter piCret was unused, but needed in code --> fixed
  * in Campy regression @Risk code in tab "meat conc distributions", column log dose interval : first and last values weird source cell in excel -> better?

### general R problems
  * R 3.X: some functions(rbinom, gamma, etc.) have only a 32bit range of numbers --> some models use numbers outside of 32bit range - solved in R4 but FSK only supports R3.X

##### status
  * found fskx file in RAKIP model repository, not fully annotated, discrepancies between code and reference
  * refers to DOI: 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01481.x --> checking that reference led to similar publication
##### todo
  * need to check if model code and code in reference are identical
  * annotation completing
