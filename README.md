      * review output parameters -> decrease number?
      * change reference from 2011 paper to efsa opinion 2020
      * fix Lindqvist CPM annotation regarding carcass size
      * steps in CPM?
      * upper bound of cdf?
    * DRM vis
      * dose uniform log steps from 0 to 8 in small steps
      * text cutoff fixing
    * RRM

### Questions for Maarten - call 2
  * visualisation of CPM ... fine, according to Maarten, confirmation?
    * Maarten:  d
  * visualisation of DRM -> changes, more infos?
    * Maarten: 
  * visualisation of RRM
    * may show all intervention scenarios at the same time (load from table) = same vis as in @Risk -> better?
    * IF ONLY one intervention scenario: should the name (FA1/2/3...) be put into visualisation?
    * which text infos in visualisation?
    * Maarten: all intervention plus one from user
  * annotation of RRM:
    * Inputs from MS skin results
       * definition?
       * how to annotate?
       * EU values are weighted average of all MS, here is just taken as input value, not calculated -> problem?
    * meat conc distributions Input scale (CFU skin) as parameter or leave it as is? how to annotate?
    * slope - definition? or where to find
    * tau - definition? or where to find
    * delta fex - definition? or where to find
  


### Questions for Maarten - call 1
#### general questions model related
  * Cret in R code is randomly chosen (normal distribution), in @Risk as abscissa with certain range for Pill
    * -> new model?s 
    * Maarten: OK
  * new visualisation dose vs cret --> possible to simulate the other plot, sampling from Cret-axis and get dose distribution
    * possible to recreate old visualization -> would that be better? 
    * Maarten: YES
    * (current visualization RAKIP models: what is ordinate? what is info i get out of it?) Distribution given Cret
  * Maxportion in RAKIP = 1000, but in @Risk no upper bound is given... what to do? 
    * Maarten: take Maxportion = 1000
  * in R models is Prev (probability of prevalence) used --> also for efsa opinion relevant? 
    * Maarten: use it in code as is
  * dose in RAKIP models only binomial distribution, dose in @Risk model is normal -> which one ? 
    * Maarten: BOTH (for either case)

#### specific CPM related questions
  * Lindqvist: Ncarcass vs Nportion? 
    * Maarten: summ Nportion to Ncarcass (1097 average carcass size)
  * Van Asselt: washed board prob =0, but unwashed board depends on hands => shouldnt washed board with unwashed hands do something? 
    * Maarten: its ok
  * calistri model: empiric transfer probability hands to meat 2x 0.6? is that correct? its a cdf, isnt it? 
    * Maarten: Mistake;
    * Marcel checked in paper: 0.8 is correct, corrected in R code, but differences are minor <1%

#### regression model questions
  *  in Campy regression @Risk code in tab "meat conc distributions", column log dose interval : first and last values weird source cell in excel -> better? 
    * Maarten: reason is matching pattern in delta -> Marcel simulates this in R code (even if changes would be minor)
 

### general R problems
  * R 3.X: some functions(rbinom, gamma, etc.) have only a 32bit range of numbers --> some models use numbers outside of 32bit range - solved in R4 but FSK only supports R3.X
