","description":"This model and all metadata included have been automatically generated from the GroPIN microbial modelling DataBase (https://www.aua.gr/psomas/gropin/, version 2020). The model code has been converted from Excel to R and the model itself is provided as an FSKX file. This FSKX model contains also an R script to visualize model-based prediction results similar to those visualizations provided by the GroPIN software. A user of the FSKX model can provide user-defined values for all model input parameters, some of them specifically introduced to customize the generated visualization."},"scope":{"product":[{"name":"Chicken _cooked_","unit":"none given"}],"hazard":[{"name":"Salmonella Typhimurium","unit":"log10(CFU)"}]},"dataBackground":{},"modelMath":{"parameter":[{"id":"T","classification":"INPUT","name":"Temperature","description":"descr Temperature","unit":"C","unitCategory":"Temperature","dataType":"VECTOROFNUMBERS","value":"seq(28.028,47.952047952048,length.out=21)"},{"id":"responseSurface","classification":"OUTPUT","name":"data frame with variables and corresponding mumax","description":"This dataframe consists of a number of columns \n                            in relation to the number of variables of this \n                            model.
