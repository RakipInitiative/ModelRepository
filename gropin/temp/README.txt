## FSK-Lab
This model is made available in the FSK-ML format, i.e. as .fskx file. To execute the model or to perform model-based predictions it is recommended to use the software FSK-Lab. FSK-Lab is an open-source extension of the open-source data analytics platform KNIME. To install FSK-Lab follow the installation instructions available at: https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/fsk-lab_de/. Once FSK-Lab is installed a new KNIME workflow should be created and the "FSKX Reader" node should be dragged into it. This "FSKX Reader" node can be configured to read in the given ".fskx" file. To perform a model-based prediction connect the out-port of the "FSKX Reader" node with the "FSK Simulation Configurator JS" node to adjust if necessary input parameters and store this into a user defined simulation setting, After that connect the output port with the input of a FSK Runner node that perform the simulation and look at the results at the node's outport.
